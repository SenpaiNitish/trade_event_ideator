# Stock News Analyzer - Complete Package

## Overview
AI-powered trade idea geneartor using ollama. A vibe coding project built with minimal hardcoding and smart modular components. This tool seamlessly switches between demo mode and production mode, delivering AI-backed market insights.

In production mode, it scrapes real-time news and event headlines from trusted sources like Moneycontrol and Zerodha Pulse. These updates are passed to an Ollama-powered AI model, which analyzes sentiment and relevance. The AI then provides concise trade ideas or alerts, directly viewable on a clean, responsive frontend.

Whether youâ€™re a trader looking for AI-generated trade calls or a developer exploring real-world integrations with Ollama and scraping tools, this project delivers a sharp and scalable experience.
